# Big refreshment of React!

I'm currently trying to refresh as many things as I could! I was trying React a couple of times but always my job requires me to focus more on other technologies. Now I have a perfect moment to reorganise all of the thoughts and knowledge that I learned.

I base this revamp on Udemy and YouTube courses because the goal is to do literally everything - Redux, TypeScript, hooks, tailwind, authorizations with some databases and maybe Next.js! So let's startin' and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svUtlHC2ph4">let's gooo</a>!

Disclaimer for poor `.scss` files. I really like writing styles, but at this moment there are so many more important things to do, so I'm using pre-given styles in 99% of the examples.

Disclaimer for taking this project serious: As I said - I'm using video courses to refresh everything, so sometimes you gonna find repetitive code or static approaches. You shouldn't look at these! 

# Branches - what can you find in this repo?

- <a href="https://github.com/GimpFather/react-course/tree/dev-expenses">`dev-expenses`</a> is the main branch that has base React knowledge, based on some Udemy course. It's a static application for keeping tabs on your expenses.
- <a href="https://github.com/GimpFather/react-course/tree/dev-todo">`dev-todo`</a> is the branch with a simple todo app. The main goal is refreshment of styling react component.
- Branches like <a href="https://github.com/GimpFather/react-course/tree/better-form">`better-form`</a> or <a href="https://github.com/GimpFather/react-course/tree/chart-bug">`chart-bug`</a> are temporary branches for bugs or future ideas.
